# Defoe
**Website defacement detection using scikit-learn, LiRE and Selenium.**

Defoe is a system for recognizing instances of [website defacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_defacement). Defoe consists of an incremental image classifier built using [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and a web app built with AngularJS. It uses a [LiRE](https://github.com/dermotte/LIRE) for feature extraction and [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) for screenshooting.
