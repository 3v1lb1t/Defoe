 Has Been Hacked This Site To Test The Strength Of The Server And Applications Running On a Server. <BR>
<BR>
 But I Discovered That The Server Is Very Weak, Does Not Have Protection, And Also Very Old Applications. <BR>
<BR>
 I Have Not Done Delete Or Sabotage Or Steal Anything From The Site Or The Database <BR>
<BR>
 You Just Change The Home Page [index.php] So You Can Easily Restore Everything <BR>
<BR> 
 Dont Forget : Black Tighr Was Here ^_^ <BR>
