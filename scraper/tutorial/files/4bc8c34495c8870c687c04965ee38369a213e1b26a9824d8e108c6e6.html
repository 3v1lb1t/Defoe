hacked by sun hacker The violence in Syria has been going on for over a year now.

Clashes between government and rebel forces are thought to have claimed the lives of over 10,000 people.

A ceasefire between the two sides was agreed in April, but the fighting has continued and now the peace plan looks like it could collapse.

But how did all this trouble start? What are the reasons behind all the violence? And what is being done to stop it getting any worse?
How did the protests start?

The trouble began in March 2011 in a Syrian city called Deraa.

Locals took to the streets to protest after 15 schoolchildren had been arrested - and reportedly tortured - for writing anti-government graffiti on a wall.

The protests were peaceful to begin with, calling for the kids' release, democracy and greater freedom for people in the country.

The government responded angrily and on 18 March, the army opened fire on protesters, killing four people.

The following day, they shot at mourners at the victims' funerals, killing another person.

People were shocked and angry at what had happened and soon the unrest had spread to other parts of the country.
What do the protesters want and what have they got?

At first the protesters just wanted democracy and greater freedom.

But once security forces opened fire on peaceful demonstrations, people demanded that the President, Bashar al-Assad resign.

President Assad has refused to step down.

As the violence worsened he has offered to change some things about the way the country is run, but the protesters don't believe him.

President Assad also has quite a lot of people in Syria that still support him and his government.
Is there any help from other countries?
The United Nations has been very critical of the violence and have sent 280 peace monitors to the country to try and keep the ceasefire.

But this doesn't seem to be working and the fighting has continued throughout their time there.

Unlike during conflicts in other countries, the UN hasn't sent in any armed troops to Syria yet.

This is because for the UN to send in troops, all the members countries of the UN have to agree - and this hasn't happened.

Russia and China have so far blocked any moves to try and do this. They have strong ties with President Assad and the Syrian government.
What happens next?

The short answer is nobody really knows.

The UK's Foreign Secretary William Hague is travelling to Russia to try and get them to force the Syrians to keep to their side of the peace plan.

If he's not successful it's uncertain what will happen next.

If the protesters get what they want and the government regime collapses, the country could descend into chaos and maybe civil war.

There is no one united group among the rebel forces, so the fight for power could continue.

One thing that seems safe to predict is that both government and rebel forces are very unlikely to give up until the other is defeated.
