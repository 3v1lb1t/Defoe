Who is Rohingya ?<br /> =============<br /> Here are the facts about Rohingya.<br /> ***************************<br />
 1. Rohingyas are not Burmese. They called themselves as Rohingya.
<br>
There
 are no such people in Burmese history and census.
<br>
2. Rohingyas are in 
fact Bengali who speaks Bengali dialect, dress Bengali clothes and eat 
Bengali food and have Bengali cultures.
<br>
3. Rohingyas are illegal 
immigrants who illegally entered to Myanmar from Bangladesh.
<br>
4. The 
Burmese government gave citizenship to many Rohingyas, but more and more
 illegal immigrant Rohingyas comes from Bangladesh every year.
<br>
5. When 
they became citizenship, they are equal under the law.
<br>
 No one may be 
discriminated against on the basis of their race, religion, ethnic 
group, or gender.
<br>
6. Rohingya raped underage girls (under 13 years old),
 tortured them and killed these little girls.
<br>
7. Rohingya bullied 
Rakhine people, did several arson attacks, killed hundreds of Rakhine 
people and burnt thousands of houses.
<br>
8. Rohingya has been trained by 
fundamentalist Taliban and Al Qaeda (cited from wikileaks and other 
credible news).
<br>
9. Rohingya owns thousands of guns to shoot Rakhine 
people.
<br>
(Please go to Rakhine state and research it. Dozens of Rakhine 
people are killed by Rohingya bullets) Myth 1. They cannot marry and 
have children.
<br>
Government restricts them.
<br>
Fact : Rohingya population 
extremely increases every year in Myanmar.
<br>
The rate is higher than 
Myanmar population rate. How come their population increases every year?
 Myth 2. They have discrimination on religion.
<br>
They don't have freedom 
of religion.
<br>
Fact : There are many mosques built by Rohingya in Rakhine 
state.
<br>
If they have restriction on religion, how come hundreds mosques 
in Rakhine state? Myth 3. They are so poor that they don't have anything
 to eat.
<br>
FACT : The truth is they just want to get free money from UNHCR
 or organizations. 
<br>
They built a lot of nice houses and mosques.
<br>
They 
bought a lot of guns and rockets. 
<br>
How can they build houses and mosques?
 How can they buy guns? Myth 4. Rohingya are not Bengali. 
<br>
FACT: Rohingya
 are in fact Benglai.
<br>
Please check DNA. Please listen their dialect. 
Please research their language.
<br>
According to the research, they are not 
Arab or Burmese ethic.
<br>
How come they speak Bengali if they are not? Why 
cannot they speak Burmese if they are burmese.
<br>
How can they wear like 
Bengali and have Bengali cultures. Myth 5. They are tortured by Rakhine 
people.
<br>
Fact: There are many Rohingya in Rakhine state. Their population
 is more than Rakhine people population.
<br>
Rohingya population increases 
every year and Rakhine population decreases every year.
<br>
If they are 
tortured by Rakhine, they will run away from Rakhine state and they 
won’t be sticking around like a super glue.
<br>
Myth 6: Rohingyas are so 
peaceful.
<br>
 Fact : Rohingya raped, tortured and killed Rakhine little 
girls.
<br>
Rohingya bullied and killed hundred of Rakhine people. They burnt
 thousands of houses and dozens of Buddhist temples.
<br>
How come the whole 
Rakhine towns and villages go to Ashes? Why are many Rakhine people 
killed by Rohingya? 
<br>
Myth 7. Government should recognize Rohingya as 
citizenship.
<br>
Fact: Bengali government denied its own people.
<br>
Burmese 
government accept them and gave them citizenship and equal rights.</div>
<br>
However, more and more Bengali Rohingya illegally enter to Myanmar every
 year.
<br>
They are rude and aggressive. They don’t respect native Rakhine 
and bullied Rakhine people.
<br>
Then, they pretend to be like poor and nice 
guys.
<br>
Why did Burmese government have to accept these kind of rude 
hypocrite terrorists?
<br>
Burmese government already gave out a lot of 
citizenship to these so-called Rohingya and they are equal under the 
law.
<br>
Nevertheless, government cannot accept any more illegal immigrants 
since they don't do any good for Myanmar. 
<br>
Myth 8 : Burmese hate Rohingya
 so much because they are Muslim.
<br>
Fact : There are plenty of Muslim 
people in Burma.
<br>
Burmese people treat with respect to those people who 
are not rude, aggressive and murderers.
<br>
Burmese people treat with 
respect to those Rohingya who entered Burma legally, and who are not 
murderers.
<br>
Short and Sweet: Rohingya are Bengali who illegally entered 
Myanmar and killed thousands of native Rakhine people.
<br>
Government gave 
citizenship and equal rights to thousands of Rohingya.
<br>
They built 
hundreds of mosques and thousands of houses in Rakhine State.
<br>
Their 
population extremely increases every year due to illegal immigrant 
Rohingyas.
<br>
They bullied, raped, tortured and killed native Rakhine 
people every year.
<br>
In this case, they are systematically attacking 
Rakhine state and Rakhine people. 
<br>
They killed many Rakhine, and burnt 
thousands of Rakhine’s houses.
<br>
They made over 30,000 Rakhine people 
homeless.
<br>
They were trained by Taliban and Al Qaeda.
<br>
Their Purpose: Even
 though government gave citizenship and equal rights to many immigrant 
Rohingyas, their desires cannot be fulfilled.
<br>
They want to make Rakhine 
state to become their state.
<br>
They want to claim that they are native 
people.
<br>
They allied with Taliban as well as Al Qaeda, and they want to 
kick Rakhine people out of Rakhine state.
<br>
They want to govern Rakhine 
state as their own state.
