<p align="center"><font color="#808000"><b><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></b></font><strong><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">WHAT IS ISLAM?</font></strong></p>
      
<p align="left"><font color="#808000"><b>Can we find an explanation of the great universe? Is there 
      any convincing interpretation of the secret of existence? We realize that 
      no family can function properly without a responsible head, that no city 
      can prosperously exist without sound administration, and that no state can 
      survive without a leader of some kind. We also realize that nothing comes 
      into being on its own. Moreover, we observe that the universe exists and 
      functions in the most orderly manner, and that it has survived for 
      hundreds of thousand of years. Can we then say that all this is accidental 
      and haphazard? Can we attribute the existence of man and the whole world 
      to mere chance.</b></font></p>
      
<p align="left"><font color="#808000"><b>Man represents only a very small portion of the great 
      universe. And if he can make plans and appreciate the merits of planning, 
      then his own existence and the survival of the universe must also be a 
      planned policy. This means that there is an extraordinary power to bring 
      things into being and keep them moving in order.</b></font></p>
      
<p align="left"><font color="#808000"><b>In the world then must be a great force in action to keep 
      everything in order. In the beautiful nature there must be a Great creator 
      who creates the most charming pieces of art produces every thing for a 
      special purpose in life. The deeply enlightened people recognize this 
      creator and call him Allah "God". He is not a man because no man can 
      create or make another man. He is not an animal, nor he is a plant. He is 
      neither an Idol nor is He a statue of any kind because non of these things 
      can make itself or create anything else. He is different from all these 
      things because he is the maker and keeper of them all. The maker of 
      anything must be different from and greater than things which he 
makes.</b></font></p>
      
<p align="left"><font color="#808000"><b>There are various ways to know God "ALLAH'' and there are 
      many things to tell about him. The great wonders and impressive marvels of 
      the world are like open books in which we can read about God. Besides, God 
      Himself comes to our aid through the many Messengers and revelations He 
      has sent down to man. These Messengers and revelations tell us everything 
      we need to know about God.</b></font></p>
      
<p align="left"><font color="#808000"><b>The complete acceptance of the teachings and guidance of God 
      'Allah' as revealed to His Messengers Muhammad is the religion of Islam. 
      Islam enjoins faith in the oneness and sovereignty of Allah, which makes 
      man aware of meaningfulness of the Universe and of his place in it. This 
      belief frees him from all fears and superstitions by making him conscious 
      of the presence of the Almighty Allah and of man's obligations towards 
      Him. This faith must be expressed and tested in actions, faith alone is 
      not enough. Belief in one God requires that we look upon all humanity as 
      one family under the universal Omnipotence of God the Creator and 
      Nourisher of all. Islam rejects the idea of chosen people, making belief 
      in God and good actions the only way to heaven. Thus, a direct 
      relationship in established with God, without any intercessor.</b></font></p>
      
<p align="left"><font color="#808000"><b>Islam is not a new religion. It is, in essence, the same 
      message and guidance which Allah revealed to all Prophets. Adam, Noah, 
      Abraham, Ismael, David, Moses and Jesus (PBUT). But the message which was 
      revealed to Prophet Mohammed (PBUT) is Islam in its comprehensive, 
      complete and final form.</b></font></p>
      
<p align="left"><font color="#808000"><b>The Quran is the last revealed word of Allah and the basic 
      source of Islamic teachings and laws. The Quran deals with the basis of 
      creeds, morality, history of humanity, worship, knowledge, wisdom, God-man 
      relationship, and human relationship in all aspects. Comprehensive 
      teaching on which, can be built sound systems of social justice, 
      economics, politics, legislation, jurisprudence, law and international 
      relations, are important contents of the Quran. Hadith, the teachings, 
      sayings and actions of Prophet Mohammed (PBUT), meticulously reported and 
      collected by his devoted companions. Explained and elaborated the Quranic 
      verses.</b></font></p>
      
<p align="center"><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">THE FUNDAMENTAL ARTICLES OF FAITH IN 
      ISLAM</font></strong></p>
      
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><strong>The true faithful Muslim believes in the following 
      Principal articles of faith:-</strong></font></p>
      
<ol>
<li><font color="#808000"><b>He believes in One God 'Allah', Supreme and Eternal, Infinite and 
        Mighty, Merciful and Compassionate, Creator and Provider. </b> 
        </font> 
        </li>
<li><font color="#808000"><b>He believes in all Messengers of God without any discrimination 
        among them. Every known nation had a warner or Messenger from God. They 
        were chosen by God to teach mankind and deliver His divine message. The 
        Quran mentions the name of twenty five of them. Among them Mohammad 
        stands as the last Messenger and the crowning glory of the foundation of 
        Prophethood. </b> 
        </font> 
        </li>
<li><font color="#808000"><b>Muslin believes in all scriptures and revelations of God. They were 
        the guiding light which the Messengers received to show their respected 
        peoples the Right Path of God. In the Quran a special reference is made 
        to the books of Abraham, Moses, David and Jesus. But long before the 
        revelations has been lost or corrupted. The only authentic and complete 
        book of God in existence in the Quran. </b> 
        </font> 
        </li>
<li><font color="#808000"><b>The true Muslim believes in the Angels of Allah. They are purely 
        spiritual and splendid beings whose nature requires on food, drink or 
        sleep. They spend their days and nights in the worship of God. </b> 
        </font> 
        </li>
<li><font color="#808000"><b>Muslim believes in the last Day of Judgement. This world will come 
        to an end someday, and the dead will rise to stand for their final and 
        fair trial. People with good records will be generously, rewarded and 
        warmly welcomed to the Heaven of Allah, and those with bad records will 
        be punished and cast into Hell. </b> 
        </font> 
        </li>
<li><font color="#808000"><b>Muslim believes in the timeless knowledge of God and His power to 
        plan and execute His planes and nothing could happen in His Kingdom 
        against His will. His knowledge and power are in action at all times and 
        command over His creation. He is wise and merciful, and whatever He does 
        must have a meaningful purpose. If this is established in our mind and 
        hearts, we should accept with good faith all that He does, although we 
        may fail to under stand it fully, or think it is bad. </b> </font> </li></ol>
      
<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><strong>THE FIVE PILLARS OF ISLAM</strong></font></p>
      
<p align="left"><font color="#808000"><b>Faith without actions arid practice is a dead end, as far as 
      Islam is concerned. Faith by nature is very sensitive and can be most 
      effective. When it is not out of practice or out of use, it quickly loses 
      its liveliness and motivation power.</b></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><strong>There are five pillars of 
      Islam:</strong></font></p>
</blockquote>
      
<ol>
<li><font color="#808000"><b>The declaration of faith: To bear witness that there is none worthy 
        of worship except Allah, and that Mohammad (PBUH) is His Messenger to 
        all human beings till the Day of Judgment. The Prophethood of Mohammad 
        obliges the Muslims to follow, His exemplary life as a model. </b> 
        </font> 
        </li>
<li><font color="#808000"><b>Prayers: Daily, prayers are offered five times a day as a duty 
        towards Allah. They strengthen and enliven the belief in Allah and 
        inspire man to a higher morality. They purify the heart and prevent 
        temptation towards wrong - doings and evil. </b> 
        </font> 
        </li>
<li><font color="#808000"><b>Fasting the month of Ramadan. The Muslims during the month of 
        Ramadan not only abstain from food, drink and sexual intercourse from 
        dawn to sunset but also sincerity and devotion. It develops a sound 
        social conscience, patience, unselfishness and will - Power. </b> 
        </font> 
        </li>
<li><font color="#808000"><b>Zakkah: The literal and simple meaning of Zakkah is purity. The 
        technical meaning of this word designates the annual amount in kind or 
        coin which a Muslim with means must distribute among the rightful 
        beneficiaries. But the religious and spiritual significance of Zakkah is 
        much deeper and more lively. So it has humanitarian and sociopolitical 
        values. </b> 
        </font> 
        </li>
<li><font color="#808000"><b>Hajj (Pilgrimage to Makkah): It is to be performed once in a 
        lifetime, if one can afford it financially and physically. </b>
