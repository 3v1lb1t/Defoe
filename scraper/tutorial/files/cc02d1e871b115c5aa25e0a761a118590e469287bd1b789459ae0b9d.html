Our response to these heinous crimes against humanity, will be on 7 April 2016. As we did many times, we'll take down your servers, government websites, Israeli military websites, banks, and public institutions. We'll erase you from cyber space as we have every year, 7 April 2016, will be an electronic holocaust, a message to the youth of Palestine, YOU are a symbol of freedom, resistance, and hope, Never give up, never give in, NEVER! We are with you, and will continue to defend you, Our message to the foolish Benjamin Netanyahu, and all leaders in the Zionist entities, As promised in previous attacks, we will continue to electronically attack until the people of Palestine are free, As shown in previous attacks, we will continue to invade and attack your devices, websites and personal data, To the government of Israel, You have NOT stopped your endless human right violations. You have NOT stopped illegal settlements. You killed thousand people as in the last war against Gaza in 2014 . You have shown that you do NOT respect international law. This is why that on April 7 2015, elite cyber-squadrons, from around the world, will decide to unite in solidarity, with the Palestinian people, against Israel, as one entity to disrupt and erase Israel from cyberspace. To the government of Israel, we always say expect us but you always fail we are unexpected we'll show you on 7 april 2016 whats the electronic holocaust mean...
