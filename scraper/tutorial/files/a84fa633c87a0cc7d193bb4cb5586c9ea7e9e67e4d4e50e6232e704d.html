		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Odisha Government reduces 1%  VAT on pulses #News #Odisha </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Odisha government has reduced the VAT on pulses to 1 percent from 5 percent for a period of three months from July 1 to check prices and provide relief to the consumers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A proposal in this regard was approved today in the State Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik here. &#8220;The objective behind the reduction of VAT on pulses of all kinds is to control the prices in the market and also to avoid strikes by traders,&#8221; Chief Secretary A P Padhi told reporters. Padhi said the state used to get a revenue of Rs 45 crore from all kinds of pulses with the VAT rate at 5 percent.</p>
<p><a href="http://eodisha.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/pulses-eodisha.org_.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-18084 alignright" src="http://eodisha.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/pulses-eodisha.org_-500x250.jpg" alt="INDORE, INDIA - OCTOBER 16: A vendor selling arhar dal pulses at a weekly market on October 16, 2015 in Indore, India. The government today said that it will buy 40,000 tonnes of pulses from farmers to create a buffer stock for controlling prices, which have soared up to Rs. 190 per kg in the retail markets. (Photo by Shankar Mourya/Hindustan Times via Getty Images)" width="330" height="165" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The state government has also accepted traders&#8217; suggestion that the state would not lose any revenue as reduction in the rate of VAT in Odisha would stop smuggling of pulses from other states, officials said. Admitting that pulses prices have reached an all-time high due to less production in the wake drought in the country, Padhi said this was one of the state government&#8217;s efforts to control price in the market. He said the Centre has been taking steps to import pulses from other countries. &#8220;When prices of these essential goods are high, if tax is added to the basic price, the retail price of these goods become very high,&#8221; Padhi said adding the state may withdraw the VAT reduction if its revenue collection was affected. &#8220;We are implementing VAT on all kinds of pulses at 1 percent for only three months on experimental basis. We hope the revenue collection will not be affected and at the same time people can get pulses at affordable price,&#8221; Padhi said.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In another decision, the Cabinet approved a new scheme <a href="http://odisha.org"><strong>OTS-2016</strong></a> for the state-run Industrial Promotion and Investment Corporation Limited (IPICOL). Though IPICOL initially provided long term financial assistance and equity participation, its Certificate of Registration (CoR) as NBFC was cancelled by the RBI in 2013. This was done in view of IPICOL&#8217;s shift in its focus and stopping its financial activities since 2005-06. &#8220;Now this approval of the state government will enable IPICOL to recover its dues and other financial activities,&#8221; Padhi said adding IPICOL had earlier introduced various One Time Settlement Schemes since 2002-03 to recover loan dues from the NPAs and the last policy adopted was amended.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The Cabinet also bestowed the responsibility to the industries department of implementing the state government&#8217;s CSR (corporate social responsibility) policy. The state&#8217;s policy says the corporates need to spend 2 percent of their profit for the overall development of the local people.</p>

		<p><strong>Nabarangpur: Basant Rath, Correspondent. </strong></p>
<p>The officials of the Nabarangpur forest division seized four leopard skin, one live Pangolin and arrested six persons from Kosagumuda border to Chhattisgarh.</p>
<p>The District Forest Officer Swayam Mallik,  said that the officials were acting on a tipoff that some  men from Chattisghar and Nabarangpur were trying to sell leopard skin. “We formed a special team led by range officer Dhanurjaya Mahapatra, with forester Jagannath Prasad Bissoiy, arrested  four poachers of Chattisghar, and two from Nabarangpur district, with the leopard skins and live Pagolin, from their possession. The forest officials also   seized four motorcycles, four mobile phones from the accused persons.  The leopard and pangolin are schedule-I animals as per wild protection Act, 1972, Mallick said four cases have been registered and six accused have already been forwarded to the court of Sub-divisional judicial magistrate, Nabarangpur.  Mallick added.<a href="http://eodisha.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160608_111032.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-17937 aligncenter" src="http://eodisha.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160608_111032-500x279.jpg" alt="20160608_111032" width="500" height="279" /></a></p>

		<p>NABARANGPUR:  BASANT RATH, Correspondent. &#8211;  Notwithstanding suitable geoclimatic condition in the district the state government has failed to encourage the farmers of this district to take up vegetables in big way. The farming community in the backward Nabarangpur district is grappling with problem of plenty. The vegetable cultivation could have been the boon for the district, where 80 percent of the families live below poverty line. Arranging funds on their own for taking up vegetable cultivation is a tough task for them. Though farmers in some parts of the district grow vegetables it is not on a large scale of the 60,000 hectares of land for suitable for vegetables farming. Only 15000 hectares is being used for the purpose.</p>

<p>Even as the farmers diversing from paddy to cash crops, including vegetables, is being promoted to raise farmers income and make agriculture sustainable for them, back-up support like proper market linkage, the right kind of seeds, fertilizers nor technical knowledge required to increase the production. is not available. Majority of the vegetable growers being small and marginal farmers, they borrow heavily from local moneylenders to by the inputs. The major vegetable growing blocks of this district are hit by lack of farmer organizations, storage, transport facilities and market support. The farmers are rendered vulnerable to exploitation by traders and middlemen, and deprived of due returns.</p>
<p>A study revealed that farmers of the backward Nabarangpur get as low as 60 percen<a href="http://eodisha.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/untitled-93.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-17927" src="http://eodisha.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/untitled-93-500x278.jpg" alt="untitled-93" width="324" height="180" /></a>t of the actual marketing price of their produce as middlemen call the shots.  Nabarangpur is one of the largest vegetable growing district in the state with 26 thousand hectares under cultivation. It is found that around 45 percent of the vegetables produced in Nabarangpur are consumed locally while around 15 percent reach different parts of the State trough traders. The rest 40 percent of vegetables like onion, chili, potato, tomato, beans, brinjal, and other vegetables including European verities, cabbage, cauliflower, beans, radish, pumpkin and coriander are grown and exported outside.</p>
<p>The tribals sell their produce in the weekly markets of Nabarangpur, Papadahandi, Umerkote, Dabugam, Raighar, Kosagumuda, Jharigam and Chandahandi, and others in the district.  Traders and middlemen, also from other states, govern the entire marketing activities. When the market channel has more than one middleman, the share of the farmers comes down to as low.</p>
<p>The anomaly can be rectified by integrating the rural markets and developing infrastructure in the way of providing storage, processing, grading and export facilities. Introduction of contract farming at regulated marketing committee level with provision of giving technical inputs from sowing to harvest and procuring produce at committed price could also raise the farmer’s income. Lack of improved farm implements, improved seeds, production and productivity has remained stagnant or even tended to go down. There is no considerable effort to reverse the decline and get vegetable farming moving forward.</p>
