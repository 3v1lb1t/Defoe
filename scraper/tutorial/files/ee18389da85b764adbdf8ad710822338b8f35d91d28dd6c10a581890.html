<p align="center"><font size="2" color="#008000">Can we find an explanation of 
the great universe? Is there any convincing interpretation of the secret of 
existence? We realize that no family can function properly without a responsible 
head, that no city can prosperously exist without sound administration, and that 
no state can survive without a leader of some kind. We also realize that nothing 
comes into being on its own. Moreover, we observe that the universe exists and 
functions in the most orderly manner, and that it has survived for hundreds of 
thousand of years. Can we then say that all this is accidental and haphazard? 
Can we attribute the existence of man and the whole world to mere chance.<br>
<br>
Man represents only a very small portion of the great universe. And if he can 
make plans and appreciate the merits of planning, then his own existence and the 
survival of the universe must also be a planned policy. This means that there is 
an extraordinary power to bring things into being and keep them moving in order.<br>
<br>
In the world then must be a great force in action to keep everything in order. 
In the beautiful nature there must be a Great creator who creates the most 
charming pieces of art produces every thing for a special purpose in life. The 
deeply enlightened people recognize this creator and call him Allah &quot;God&quot;. He is 
not a man because no man can create or make another man. He is not an animal, 
nor he is a plant. He is neither an Idol nor is He a statue of any kind because 
non of these things can make itself or create anything else. He is different 
from all these things because he is the maker and keeper of them all. The maker 
of anything must be different from and greater than things which he makes.<br>
<br>
There are various ways to know God &quot;ALLAH'' and there are many things to tell 
about him. The great wonders and impressive marvels of the world are like open 
books in which we can read about God. Besides, God Himself comes to our aid 
through the many Messengers and revelations He has sent down to man. These 
Messengers and revelations tell us everything we need to know about God.<br>
<br>
The complete acceptance of the teachings and guidance of God 'Allah' as revealed 
to His Messengers Muhammad is the religion of Islam. Islam enjoins faith in the 
oneness and sovereignty of Allah, which makes man aware of meaningfulness of the 
Universe and of his place in it. This belief frees him from all fears and 
superstitions by making him conscious of the presence of the Almighty Allah and 
of man's obligations towards Him. This faith must be expressed and tested in 
actions, faith alone is not enough. Belief in one God requires that we look upon 
all humanity as one family under the universal Omnipotence of God the Creator 
and Nourisher of all. Islam rejects the idea of chosen people, making belief in 
God and good actions the only way to heaven. Thus, a direct relationship in 
established with God, without any intercessor.<br>
<br>
Islam is not a new religion. It is, in essence, the same message and guidance 
which Allah revealed to all Prophets. Adam, Noah, Abraham, Ismael, David, Moses 
and Jesus (PBUT). But the message which was revealed to Prophet Mohammed (PBUT) 
is Islam in its comprehensive, complete and final form.<br>
