" Indian Penal Code Act No. 45 of 1860) CHAPTER-II SEC 18: India.- India means the territory of India excluding the State of Jammu and Kashmir." <br> This institutionalized impunity with which the killings of civilians by military and police forces in Jammu and Kashmir continues should be a source of shame for India which propagates to be a democracy! <br<br> Kashmir does not want militarized governance - STOP killing children, raping women and imprisoning the men! <br> They just want freedom! Freedom from the evil of the Indian Military! <br>

Ghandi said - Freedom is never dear at any price. It is the breath of life. What would a man not pay for living? <br>

Everyday 100s of innocent people are abused, raped and even killed in Kashmir by the Indian army, a third of the deaths are children, <br> - we don't want war, take back your men, your guns and go back to where you came from<br> All we ask is for freedom, you can kill us but you cant kill us all, we shall not give up,<br><img src="http://aringsideview.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/kashmir_protest11.jpg"><br><font color =red size =8>Security Is Just An Illusion<br>| Alone Injector | AlOne HaXar | Kashmiri Hunter | Devil Killer | Muhammad Bilal |
