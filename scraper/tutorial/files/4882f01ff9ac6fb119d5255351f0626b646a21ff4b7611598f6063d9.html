Greetings world,<br>
for years we have had to endure viacom's attempts to strip away the
basic rights of the indivadual.<br>
We Persistently have been silenced, and coincidently, the free flow of
information has been limited<br>
<br>
thousands of people have undergone the unfortunate experience of
receiving falsely-claimed copyright infringements:<br>
for far too long have we have had to share an enraged commonality in
helpessly waitnessing totalitarian like actions take place.<br>
Nonetheless. the thwarting of information is one think - the logging of
milions of IP addresses and personal information is another,<br>
this extends beyond the domain of acceptability when one's capitalistic
agenda interferes with exploits and profits through.<br>
infringing uponn an individual's freedom,<br>
endorse the people's right and hereby demand a refund<br>
within the aftermath of losing your lawsuit against YouTube, you do not
cease to continously milk it for money<br>
your justiflaction of "Creato's rights" seems to instead to be making
money for the sake of money: and your hypperitical<br>
actions in uploading fake videos to YouTube to help Furnish your case,
are transparent: !<br>
<br>
we demands from viacom a public press release to admit and publicly
apologize for their fraud and crimes they have commited !!<br>
we are |<a style="color: white;" href="fb.com/AlFeRoX19">AlFeRoX</a> | </span><a style="color: white;" href="fb.com/127.0.0.1Host"><span style="color: white;">B3d0M4D0 </span></a><span style="color: white;">|<br>
we are not terrorist !<br>

<h3><span style="color: white;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">!Cheers!</span></span></h3>
